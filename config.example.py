##### Referencing landmarks in your tweets/notifications

#### It is recommended to store the LANDMARKS object in a pickle to reduce startup
#### time if you are using queries. An example script for this is in:
#### scripts/pickle_landmarks.example.py
#from pickle import load
#with open('pickles/landmarks.pickle', 'rb') as f:
#    LANDMARKS = load(f)

### if you do pickle it, just load the pickle and omit everything below this point

#from monocle.landmarks import Landmarks
#LANDMARKS = Landmarks(query_suffix=AREA_NAME)

# Landmarks to reference when Pokémon are nearby
# If no points are specified then it will query OpenStreetMap for the coordinates
# If 1 point is provided then it will use those coordinates but not create a shape
# If 2 points are provided it will create a rectangle with its corners at those points
# If 3 or more points are provided it will create a polygon with vertices at each point
# You can specify the string to search for on OpenStreetMap with the query parameter
# If no query or points is provided it will query with the name of the landmark (and query_suffix)
# Optionally provide a set of hashtags to be used for tweets about this landmark
# Use is_area for neighborhoods, regions, etc.
# When selecting a landmark, non-areas will be chosen first if any are close enough
# the default phrase is 'in' for areas and 'at' for non-areas, but can be overriden for either.

### replace these with well-known places in your area

## since no points or query is provided, the names provided will be queried and suffixed with AREA_NAME
#LANDMARKS.add('Rice Eccles Stadium', shortname='Rice Eccles', hashtags={'Utes'})
#LANDMARKS.add('the Salt Lake Temple', shortname='the temple', hashtags={'TempleSquare'})

## provide two corner points to create a square for this area
#LANDMARKS.add('City Creek Center', points=((40.769210, -111.893901), (40.767231, -111.888275)), hashtags={'CityCreek'})

## provide a query that is different from the landmark name so that OpenStreetMap finds the correct one
#LANDMARKS.add('the State Capitol', shortname='the Capitol', query='Utah State Capitol Building')

### area examples ###
## query using name, override the default area phrase so that it says 'at (name)' instead of 'in'
#LANDMARKS.add('the University of Utah', shortname='the U of U', hashtags={'Utes'}, phrase='at', is_area=True)
## provide corner points to create a polygon of the area since OpenStreetMap does not have a shape for it
#LANDMARKS.add('Yalecrest', points=((40.750263, -111.836502), (40.750377, -111.851108), (40.751515, -111.853833), (40.741212, -111.853909), (40.741188, -111.836519)), is_area=True)
